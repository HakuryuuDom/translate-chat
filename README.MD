# translate-chat
translates incoming chat text into another language

## Info
- Default is translate text into English.
- Use language codes to set ('en' = English, 'es' = Spanish, etc.) [Click here](https://ctrlq.org/code/19899-google-translate-languages) for list of codes.
- The in-game font may not support characters for all languages.
- Translations take a second to process so if chat is getting spammed then incoming translated text may be out of order.
